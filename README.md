# Colour Capture Tool
 A tool I built to continuously track the cursor's position and capture pixel colour information.

 The inability to acquire colours in pictures forced me to make this tool

 It doesn't work on my 32" UJ590 UHD Samsung Monitor
 Works on my AOC C24G1 Monitor
 GPU - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti
 I can't test it on all monitors and GPU's sorry
