# Colour Capture Tool
 Tool I built to continuously tracks the cursor's position and captures pixel colour information.

 The inability to acquire colours in pictures forced me to make this tool

 Doesn't work on my 32" UJ590 UHD Samsung Monitor
 Works on my AOC C24G1 Monitor
 GPU - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti
 Can't test it on all monitors and GPU's sorry
